# Visa
If your country is not part of the [Schengen Agreement](https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/who-needs-schengen-visa/), you will need to request a tourist Visa in the Danish Embassy. We have spoken to the Danish Immigration Office and below we have compiled a list of documents you will need to provide when requesting the travel document. Have in mind that this process can take some months, therefore we recommend starting it as soon as possible.


* An invitation letter from the DjangoCon Organiation Team
After you have purchased your DjangoCon ticket, send an e-mail to hospitality@djangocon.eu with: the purchased ticket, your full name, your address, a copy of your passport, your company and/or university name and address. 
 
* Travel insurance covering the entire Schengen area which is valid for the expected duration of your stay. The minimum coverage must be 30,000 EUR.

* A passport or other valid travel document. Your passport/travel document must be valid for at least three months after your planned departure date. Moreover, your passport/travel document must have been issued within the past ten years and must have at least two blank pages.
 
* A passport photo measuring 35mm x 45mm. The distance from your chin to the top of your head should measure between 30mm and 36mm. The photograph should bear a close resemblance to your current appearance and you should be facing the camera directly.
 
* Relevant documentation, such as documentation for the purpose of the visit and business branch (business license or registration certificate issued by authorities in the home country, previous trade in the same industry, etc.), proof that you have available accommodation, proof that you have sufficient means at your disposal to cover your living expenses as well as your travel home. You should also include information that will allow immigration authorities to determine whether you plan to leave the Schengen region when your visa expires.
