# Accessibility

We are observant of the needs for accessibility both for the physical space of the venue and for the event itself. We will be adding more information about this, as we are more certain of all the details. You are welcome to write us about any specific needs: [2019@djangocon.eu](mailto:2019@djangocon.eu)
